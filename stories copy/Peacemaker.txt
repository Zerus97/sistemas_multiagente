The legend of "The Great Peacemaker" tells how the Iroquois Confederacy was united through wisdom, peace, and cooperation. Once, the five nations—Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca—were trapped in endless cycles of war, driven by revenge and power struggles.  

During this turmoil, the Great Peacemaker arrived, urging unity. He traveled from tribe to tribe, preaching respect, collaboration, and dialogue over violence. Though leaders resisted at first, his message of peace took root. He envisioned a great tree—the Tree of Great Peace—symbolizing unity, with deep roots of understanding and strong branches of cooperation.  

The leaders eventually agreed to meet beneath this tree, forming the Grand Council of the Iroquois. Instead of war, they embraced governance through discussion and consensus, ensuring every voice was heard. With unity, the Iroquois thrived, demonstrating that peace is built through cooperation, not force.  

The Peacemaker’s legacy lived on, shaping one of history’s most successful systems of governance. His story teaches that true strength lies in unity and that lasting peace is created through dialogue, respect, and shared purpose.
