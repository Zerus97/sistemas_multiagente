The fable of "The Old Man and His Sons" teaches that unity brings strength while division leads to weakness. An aging father, troubled by his sons’ constant quarrels, realizes words alone won’t make them see the value of standing together.  

He gathers them and presents a tightly bound bundle of sticks, asking each to break it. One by one, they fail. Then, he unties the bundle and hands them single sticks, which they snap with ease. He explains that, like the sticks, they are unbreakable together but fragile apart.  

The sons finally understand. They realize that if they continue fighting, they will struggle against life’s hardships alone. But if they support one another, they will remain strong. From that day forward, they set aside their quarrels, working together instead of against each other.  

The fable teaches that unity is the key to resilience. Families, communities, and teams overcome obstacles when they cooperate. True strength lies not in standing alone, but in standing together.
