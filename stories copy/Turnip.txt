The story of "The Giant Turnip" teaches that even the biggest challenges can be overcome through teamwork. A farmer plants a turnip, expecting a good harvest, but as it grows, it becomes far larger than he imagined. When the time comes to pull it from the ground, he grips the leaves and pulls with all his might—but the turnip does not budge.  

Realizing he cannot do it alone, he calls his wife. Together, they strain and tug, but the stubborn turnip remains rooted. They call their granddaughter, who eagerly joins in, yet even with three pulling, the turnip stays firm. Determined not to give up, they enlist the dog, then the cat, each adding their strength, but still, the turnip holds fast.  

Finally, they call on a tiny mouse. Though small, the mouse takes its place at the end of the line. With one last mighty effort, they all pull together—farmer, wife, granddaughter, dog, cat, and mouse—and at last, the enormous turnip bursts free from the soil.  

Laughter and cheers erupt as they realize that without each and every helper, they would not have succeeded. Even the smallest among them played a vital role. They gather to share their harvest, grateful for the power of teamwork.  

The story reminds us that no effort is too small and no helper insignificant when working toward a shared goal. Through cooperation, even the most difficult tasks can be accomplished, proving that success is sweetest when achieved together.
