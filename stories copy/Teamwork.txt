In a lush meadow, a group of children played near a towering apple tree, its branches heavy with ripe, red apples. The delicious fruit tempted them, but the lowest branches were far beyond their reach. One by one, they jumped, stretched, and even tried using sticks, but each effort ended in failure. Frustration grew as they realized no single child could reach the apples alone.  

Then, one child suggested they work together. Excited by the idea, they quickly formed a plan. Some knelt to form a sturdy base, while others climbed onto their backs. The tallest child balanced at the top, stretching their arms as far as they could. At first, they wobbled, but the children at the base adjusted, strengthening their support. Encouraged by their teamwork, the topmost child reached even higher and finally grasped the first apple. Cheers erupted as they passed the fruit down, ensuring everyone got a share.  

Inspired by their success, they continued, each child taking turns at different rolesâ€”some climbing, some supporting, and others catching the apples as they fell. Through cooperation, they turned an impossible task into a joyful accomplishment.  

As they sat together, enjoying their well-earned apples, they realized a valuable lesson: by combining their strengths and working as a team, they could overcome challenges that seemed impossible alone. Their success was not just in reaching the apples, but in learning that unity, trust, and shared effort made them stronger together.
